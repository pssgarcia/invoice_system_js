This project allows users to dynamically create their invoice system.

By selecting your id and name, you will see a table full of products that you can select and add to another table, which will display the price, amount and total for you. 

You can also choose your own product by simply filling out the inputs above the table.

Once you're done with your products selection and click save, your name and id will be saved to the local storage, so that next time you type your id and hit enter, your products invoice will be shown.
